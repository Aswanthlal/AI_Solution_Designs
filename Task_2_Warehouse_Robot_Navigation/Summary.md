# Problem Title
Autonomous Warehouse Robot Navigation System

## Problem Description
Warehouse robots often cause delays, collisions, and require manual monitoring.  
In addition, unexpected breakdowns and lack of predictive maintenance result in costly downtime and workflow interruptions.  
Target users are logistics and operations managers who need safer, smoother, and more reliable automated warehouse operations.

## Proposed AI/ML Solution
An integrated AI-based navigation and maintenance system.

- **Data Collection:** LIDAR and camera sensors (via IoT) capture spatial and environmental data; internal sensors monitor temperature, vibration, and motor performance.  
- **Preprocessing:** Sensor normalization, image enhancement, and noise reduction.  
- **Model:**  
  - CNN for obstacle detection and environment perception  
  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) for optimal path planning and navigation  
  - Predictive Maintenance Model (Regression / Anomaly Detection) for forecasting potential robot failures  

**Workflow:** Real-time edge inference for navigation + cloud-based retraining for improved models.

## Cloud & Tech Stack
- **IoT Services:** AWS Greengrass / Azure IoT Hub  
- **Model Training:** AWS SageMaker / GCP AI Platform  
- **Data Storage:** AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage  
- **Deployment:** Edge inference on robots; periodic model updates from the cloud  
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch / Azure Monitor  

## Expected Outcome / Impact
- Faster deliveries with optimal routing  
- Reduced collisions and enhanced safety  
- Minimized downtime via predictive maintenance  
- Improved operational efficiency and real-time monitoring
