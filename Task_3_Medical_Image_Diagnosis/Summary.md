# Problem Title
Automated Disease Detection from Medical Images

## Problem Description
Manual diagnosis from X-rays or CT scans is slow and error-prone, delaying critical treatments.  
Target users are radiologists and diagnostic centers.

## Proposed AI/ML Solution
Deep learning-based disease detection using **CNN / Transfer Learning (ResNet / MobileNet)**.  
Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, augmentation.

**Workflow:** Image Upload → Preprocessing → Model Inference → Diagnosis Report

## Cloud & Tech Stack
- **Storage:** AWS S3 / GCP Cloud Storage  
- **Training:** AWS SageMaker / Azure ML  
- **Inference:** AWS Lambda / Azure Function  
- **Interface:** Streamlit / Flask web app  
- **Monitoring:** SageMaker Model Monitor / Azure ML Dashboard  

## Expected Outcome / Impact
- Faster, accurate image-based disease detection  
- Reduced radiologist workload  
- Real-time reporting and insights
